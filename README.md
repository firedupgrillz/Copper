This is the collection of data and python code I used to create results I used in my dissertation for an MSc in Financial Management from SOAS. 
Tables 1-4 contains data from 3 major commodity exchanges daily closing prices for copper from 2012-2024. 
The copper mining companies share prices are listed in the file V8_data. 
The python code featured in the file Dissertation Workflow file parses the data from the sources, interpolates them into a daily, time-series data set and then runs various regression tests on them. 
The introductory steps to run a linear regression based machine learning test to "test" the predictive power of variables is also featured. 
Within the V8_data file, there is a selection of variables such as daily prices for Crude Oil, Gold, Tesla and BYD are also included for additional simple linear regression tests and MV regression tests. 
Ultimately the findings of the analysis, indicate a path forward to better understand flucctuations in copper exchange prices using major copper mining companies share prices. 
This understanding and future inclusion of additional variables including mine ore quality data, status of mine closures and/or company specific governance events could improve the possibility of forecasting copper exchange prices into the future.
