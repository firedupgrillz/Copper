This collection includes the data and Python code used to generate the results for my dissertation as part of my MSc in Financial Management at SOAS.
Tables 1-4 contain daily closing prices for copper from 2012-2024 across three major commodity exchanges. Share prices of copper mining companies are provided in the file V8_data.
The Python code in the Dissertation Workflow file processes the raw data, interpolates it into a daily time series, and runs various regression tests. 
Additionally, introductory steps for running a machine learning model based on linear regression are included, aimed at evaluating the predictive power of certain variables.
The V8_data file also includes variables such as daily prices for crude oil, gold, Tesla, and BYD, which could be used for both simple and multivariate regression tests.
Ultimately, the findings highlight a potential path forward in understanding fluctuations in copper exchange prices using the share prices of major copper mining companies. 
Incorporating additional variables, such as mine ore quality data, mine closures, and company-specific governance events, could be further developed to in future projects that attempt to forecast copper exchange prices into the future.
